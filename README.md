This was my first project as a programmer, three weeks into my General Assembly Web Development Immersive. My original plan was to create a Lord of the Rings based chance game where the player can select his own route through different levels. To do this, I used Javascript to create game logic that randomized where 'The Eye of Sauron' looked during each phase. If you chose the point where the eye was looking, you would lose a life.

To make sure the player understood where they stand, I created a scoreboard that counted their lives, the round they were on, and their total points. Points are awarded as follows, 1 point for avoiding the eye at each point in the first round, 3 points for avoiding the eye at each point in the second round, 5 points for avoiding the eye at each point in the third round, and 10 for successfully winning the game.

As it wasn't readily obvious how to begin, I created a start screen with a start button and a modal to describe the game to the user. As the game and my coding evolved, I started implementing additional DOM manipulation to update what the user was seeing on a level to level basis. Instead of just receiving an alert saying the user lost the game, I added gifs showing the nazgul catching Frodo. I also added one for when you won the game.

As this was my first attempt at a game via Javascript, there's a lot that could have been done more efficiently. The game logic could have used some additional loops to avoid repeating code. Additionally, the classes in CSS are in need of an update as they don't efficiently disseminate code throughout the page.

Ultimately I'm pleased with how it came out. I feel that if I broke this down and restarted, I could create much more efficient code using DRY principles. While I would love to do that, I believe my programming skills have progressed to a point that I would like to tackle bigger challenges. The Eye of Sauron may receive some additional updates, but for all intents and purposes, it is complete.
